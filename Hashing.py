# Import the necessary libraries for hashing and secure password input

# Get the password from the user without echoing it to the console

# Create a new hash object using a secure algorithm (e.g. SHA-256)

# Update the hash object with the password bytes

# Get the hexadecimal representation of the hash

# Print the stored hash (for testing purposes)

# Get the password from the user again for verification

# Hash the input password using the same algorithm as before

# Compare the stored hash with the input hash

# Check if the passwords match and print a success or failure message
