# - Goal: Create a tool that evaluates password strength and provides feedback
# - Requirements:
#     - Take user input (password)
#     - Check password length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and similarity to common passwords
#     - Provide feedback (weak, medium, strong)
#     - Optionally, compare input password with stored hashes (e.g., common passwords)
